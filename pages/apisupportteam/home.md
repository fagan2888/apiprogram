# What's the API Program Support Team?

The API Program Support Team is a small working group comprised research and IT members with a special focus on APIs and the IPUMS API Program. Our mission is to foster the development of IPUMS APIs through stakeholder engagement and standards and best practices development. We meet monthly to review API initiatives and are committed to spearheading the development of a strong API Program at IPUMS.

We were [formally chartered in 2017 as the API Governance Working Group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dp5OebToh2EDAZ1LbnAayUeX2DBBFodt2kqNtlukQKs/edit?usp=sharing). That document has more details about our mission. The group is structured as two subcommittees, the business subcommittee which focuses on the business aspects of APIs (e.g. developing roadmaps, engaging with users, staff education) and the technical subcommittee for the technical aspects (e.g. modeling exercises, style guide, code reviews).

## How Can We Help?

Lots of ways, including:

* staff education
* cross-organization coordination
* generating API roadmaps
* stakeholder input gathering (including external users and partners)
* publishing an API style guide
* facilitating API modeling and design exercises for your team
* reviewing your team's API implementation

Basically, if you need help with APIs, reach out to us!
